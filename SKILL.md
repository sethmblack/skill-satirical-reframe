# Satirical Reframe

Transform dry, serious, or preachy content into humorous observation that makes the same point more effectively and memorably, using Mark Twain's satirical techniques.

---

## When to Use

- User asks "Make this funnier" or "Give me the Twain version"
- Content is correct but boring, preachy, or unmemorable
- Serious point needs to land without lecturing
- Request to make criticism more palatable
- Need to expose hypocrisy or foolishness without attacking directly

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| content | Yes | The serious content, argument, or observation to transform |
| target | No | What/who is being critiqued (institution, behavior, idea) |
| tone | No | How sharp to make it (gentle, moderate, devastating) |

## The Four Satirical Techniques

### Technique 1: The Innocent Observation

State the absurdity as if it were the most natural thing in the world. Play naive. Let the reader see the foolishness you pretend not to notice.

**Formula:** [Absurd thing] presented as [perfectly reasonable observation]

**Example transformation:**
- Before: "Politicians often make promises they have no intention of keeping."
- After: "A politician is a man who approaches every subject with an open mouth."

### Technique 2: The Deadpan Comparison

Draw an unexpected parallel that illuminates the truth through contrast or exaggeration.

**Formula:** [X] is like [unexpected Y] because [the real point]

**Example transformation:**
- Before: "Corporate mission statements rarely reflect actual company behavior."
- After: "A corporate mission statement is the Ten Commandments for atheists - everybody agrees it's a fine thing, and nobody expects anyone to follow it."

### Technique 3: The Inversion

Flip the expected framing. If they claim virtue, examine the vice. If they claim necessity, examine the choice.

**Formula:** What they say → What they mean

**Example transformation:**
- Before: "Many meetings are unnecessarily long and unproductive."
- After: "A meeting is an event where minutes are kept and hours are lost."

### Technique 4: The Hypothetical Telling

Create a brief scenario or imagined situation that makes the absurdity vivid.

**Formula:** Suppose [situation that reveals the truth]...

**Example transformation:**
- Before: "Congress is often ineffective at solving problems."
- After: "Suppose you were an idiot. And suppose you were a member of Congress. But I repeat myself."

## The Reframe Process

### Step 1: Identify the Core Truth
What is the actual point being made? Strip away all the polite language and qualifications.

### Step 2: Find the Gap
Where is the hypocrisy, foolishness, or contradiction? What do people SAY versus what they DO?

### Step 3: Choose Your Weapon
Which technique fits best?
- Innocent observation: for institutional foolishness
- Deadpan comparison: for abstract concepts
- Inversion: for claims of virtue
- Hypothetical telling: for complex situations

### Step 4: Write the Punch
Draft the satirical version. Aim for:
- One memorable line rather than a paragraph
- The sting in the tail (save the punch for the end)
- Warmth underneath (satirize ideas, not people)

### Step 5: Test the Landing
Does it make the same point? Is it funnier? Would you remember it tomorrow?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Satirical Reframe

### Original Point
[Restate the core truth in one sentence]

### The Gap
[What contradiction or foolishness is being exposed]

### Technique Used
[Which of the four techniques]

### The Reframe
[The satirical version - aim for 1-3 punchy sentences]

### Why It Works
[Brief explanation of how the humor serves the point]
```

---

## Constraints

- Never be cruel to individuals - satirize behaviors and institutions
- Maintain the original point - don't lose accuracy for a laugh
- Keep it quotable - if it can't be remembered, it won't spread
- Punch up, not down - target the powerful, not the powerless
- Include the twinkle - even sharp satire should have warmth

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "Social media companies claim to care about user mental health while designing their products to be as addictive as possible."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Satirical Reframe

### Original Point
Social media companies prioritize engagement over user wellbeing.

### The Gap
Public statements about user mental health vs. business model built on addiction.

### Technique Used
Deadpan Comparison + Inversion

### The Reframe
"Social media companies care deeply about your mental health. That's why they hired the world's finest psychologists - to figure out exactly how to make you unable to stop scrolling. It's like a candy company hiring dentists. They know all about teeth; they just don't want you to keep yours."

### Why It Works
The comparison to candy companies and dentists makes the conflict of interest concrete and absurd. The progression from apparent care to revealed manipulation mirrors how users experience the platform - drawn in by the promise of connection, trapped by the design.
